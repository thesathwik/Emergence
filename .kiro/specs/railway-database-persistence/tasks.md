# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Clean up Railway configuration files
  - Remove duplicate railway.json file to avoid configuration conflicts
  - Ensure railway.toml is the single source of truth for deployment configuration
  - Verify volume configuration syntax and settings
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 2. Enhance database initialization with backup system
  - [x] 2.1 Create database backup utility functions
    - Implement createDatabaseBackup() function to copy database with timestamp
    - Implement cleanupOldBackups() function to maintain only last 5 backups
    - Add backup verification with file size and checksum validation
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

  - [x] 2.2 Integrate backup system into database initialization
    - Modify initializeDatabase() to create backup before migrations
    - Add backup directory creation and management
    - Implement error handling for backup failures
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Improve volume detection and error handling
  - [x] 3.1 Enhance volume mount verification
    - Add comprehensive volume directory checks (exists, writable, mounted)
    - Implement detailed logging for volume status and operations
    - Add volume space availability checks
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 3.2 Implement robust fallback mechanisms
    - Improve error handling when volume mount fails
    - Add graceful degradation with detailed warning messages
    - Implement retry logic for volume directory creation
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Add volume health monitoring to health endpoint
  - Extend /api/health endpoint to include volume status information
  - Add database connectivity and file system checks
  - Include backup status and last backup timestamp
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Test database persistence across deployments
  - Create test data in database
  - Verify data persists after simulated deployment
  - Test backup creation and restoration functionality
  - Validate error handling scenarios
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
