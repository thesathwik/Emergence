# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Railway deployment is losing database data on every code push/deployment. The application is configured to use SQLite with Railway volumes for persistence, but the data is still being lost during deployments. This feature will ensure proper database persistence across deployments by fixing the volume configuration and implementing proper backup/restore mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the database to persist across deployments, so that user data, agents, and application state are not lost when code changes are pushed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new deployment occurs THEN the existing database data SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to the persistent volume-mounted database
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL be written to the persistent storage location
4. IF the volume mount fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and fallback gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database backup mechanisms, so that data can be recovered in case of corruption or accidental loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL create a backup of the existing database if one exists
2. WHEN a backup is created THEN it SHALL be stored in the persistent volume with a timestamp
3. WHEN multiple backups exist THEN the system SHALL maintain only the last 5 backups to save space
4. IF backup creation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue normal operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of database operations, so that I can troubleshoot persistence issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database connection is established THEN the system SHALL log the database path and volume status
2. WHEN volume directory operations occur THEN the system SHALL log success or failure with detailed information
3. WHEN database migrations run THEN the system SHALL log each migration step and result
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including file paths and permissions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want my uploaded agents and account data to persist, so that I don't lose my work when the platform is updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload an agent THEN it SHALL be stored in persistent storage
2. WHEN I create an account THEN my user data SHALL persist across deployments
3. WHEN I download agents THEN the download counts SHALL be maintained across deployments
4. WHEN the platform is updated THEN all my data SHALL remain accessible
