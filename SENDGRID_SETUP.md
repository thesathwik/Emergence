# SendGrid Sender Identity Setup

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue
**Error**: `The from address does not match a verified Sender Identity`

SendGrid requires you to verify the email address you want to send from before you can send emails.

## ðŸ”§ Solution Steps

### Option 1: Verify Single Sender (Recommended)

1. **Go to SendGrid Dashboard**:
   - Login at: https://app.sendgrid.com
   - Navigate to: **Settings** â†’ **Sender Authentication**

2. **Add Single Sender**:
   - Click **"Verify a Single Sender"**
   - Enter email: `emergence.a2a@gmail.com`
   - Fill out the form with your details
   - Click **"Create"**

3. **Check Email**:
   - Check `emergence.a2a@gmail.com` inbox
   - Click verification link in SendGrid email
   - Confirm verification in SendGrid dashboard

### Option 2: Use Different Email (Alternative)

If you can't access `emergence.a2a@gmail.com`, use an email you own:

1. **Add to Railway Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-email@domain.com
   ```

2. **Verify that email in SendGrid**:
   - Follow Option 1 steps with your email
   - Make sure it's verified before testing

## ðŸ“‹ Railway Environment Update

Add this variable to your Railway project:

```bash
FROM_EMAIL=emergence.a2a@gmail.com  # After verification
```

Or use your own verified email:

```bash
FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-email@domain.com
```

## âœ… Verification Checklist

- [ ] Login to SendGrid Dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to Settings â†’ Sender Authentication
- [ ] Add Single Sender: `emergence.a2a@gmail.com`
- [ ] Complete verification process
- [ ] Confirm email is verified (green checkmark)
- [ ] Test email sending

## ðŸš€ After Verification

Once the sender email is verified:

1. **Redeploy your app** (Railway auto-deploys on git push)
2. **Test registration** at your site
3. **Check logs** for successful email delivery
4. **Verify email arrives** in inbox

## ðŸ“§ Expected Success Messages

After verification, you should see:
```
âœ… Email sent successfully via SendGrid Web API
```

Instead of the 403 error.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **Use a domain you own** for better deliverability
- **Set up domain authentication** for even better email reputation
- **Monitor SendGrid analytics** for delivery insights
- **Keep sender identity active** by sending emails regularly
