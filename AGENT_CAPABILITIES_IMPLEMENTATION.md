# Agent Capabilities Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive agent capabilities system to the Emergence platform, allowing agents to declare their capabilities and enabling users to discover agents based on what they can do.

## Database Schema

### New Tables

#### 1. `capability_categories`
Stores predefined capability categories that agents can declare.

```sql
CREATE TABLE capability_categories (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  display_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. `agent_capabilities`
Many-to-many relationship table linking agents to their capabilities.

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_capabilities (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  agent_id INTEGER REFERENCES agents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  capability_category_id INTEGER REFERENCES capability_categories(id),
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(agent_id, capability_category_id)
);
```

## Predefined Capability Categories

The system includes 15 predefined capability categories:

1. **Email Processing** - Can send, receive, and process email communications
2. **Data Processing** - Can analyze, transform, and manipulate data sets
3. **Customer Support** - Can handle customer inquiries and provide support responses
4. **Content Generation** - Can create written content, articles, and documentation
5. **Web Scraping** - Can extract and collect data from websites and web sources
6. **API Integration** - Can connect with and utilize external APIs and services
7. **File Processing** - Can read, write, and manipulate various file formats
8. **Scheduling** - Can manage calendars, appointments, and time-based tasks
9. **Database Operations** - Can perform database queries, updates, and data management
10. **System Monitoring** - Can monitor systems, services, and provide alerts
11. **Social Media** - Can interact with social media platforms and manage content
12. **Image Processing** - Can analyze, edit, and generate images
13. **Natural Language Processing** - Can understand and process natural language text
14. **Machine Learning Prediction** - Can make predictions using machine learning models
15. **Workflow Automation** - Can automate business processes and workflows

## API Endpoints

### Capability Management

#### `GET /api/capabilities`
Get all active capability categories.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Found 15 capability categories",
  "capabilities": [...],
  "count": 15
}
```

#### `GET /api/capabilities/:id`
Get a specific capability by ID.

#### `GET /api/agents/:id/capabilities`
Get capabilities for a specific agent.

#### `POST /api/agents/:id/capabilities`
Update capabilities for a specific agent (requires authentication).

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "capability_ids": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

#### `GET /api/capabilities/:id/agents`
Get all agents that have a specific capability.

### Enhanced Agent Endpoints

#### `GET /api/agents?capabilities=1,2,3&match_all=true`
Search agents by capabilities:
- `capabilities`: Comma-separated list of capability IDs
- `match_all`: Whether to match all capabilities (true) or any (false, default)

#### `POST /api/agents` (Enhanced)
Create agent endpoint now accepts capabilities in the form data:

```javascript
FormData.append('capabilities', JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]));
```

#### `GET /api/agents/:id?include_capabilities=true`
Get agent details with optional capabilities included.

## Frontend Components

### CapabilitySelector Component
New React component for selecting multiple capabilities with:
- Search/filter functionality
- Visual checkbox interface
- Select all/clear all buttons
- Selected capabilities summary

### Enhanced UploadForm
Updated to include capability selection:
- Integrated CapabilitySelector component
- Capabilities are optional during agent upload
- Form validation and error handling

## Database Helper Functions

### New Database Methods
- `getAllCapabilities()` - Get all active capabilities
- `getCapabilityById(id)` - Get capability by ID
- `getAgentCapabilities(agentId)` - Get capabilities for an agent
- `addAgentCapability(agentId, capabilityId)` - Add single capability
- `removeAgentCapability(agentId, capabilityId)` - Remove capability
- `setAgentCapabilities(agentId, capabilityIds)` - Replace all capabilities
- `getAgentsByCapability(capabilityId)` - Get agents with capability
- `searchAgentsByCapabilities(capabilityIds, matchAll)` - Search by multiple capabilities

## Frontend API Service

### New API Methods
- `getCapabilities()` - Fetch all capabilities
- `getCapability(id)` - Fetch single capability
- `getAgentCapabilities(agentId)` - Fetch agent capabilities
- `updateAgentCapabilities(agentId, capabilityIds)` - Update capabilities
- `getAgentsByCapability(capabilityId)` - Get agents by capability
- `searchAgentsByCapabilities(capabilityIds, matchAll)` - Search by capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Agent with Capabilities

```javascript
// Frontend form submission
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('name', 'My AI Agent');
formData.append('description', 'Does amazing things');
formData.append('category', 'AI');
formData.append('author_name', 'John Doe');
formData.append('capabilities', JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3])); // Email, Data Processing, Customer Support
formData.append('file', zipFile);

await apiService.uploadAgent(formData);
```

### Searching for Agents by Capabilities

```javascript
// Find agents that can do email processing OR data processing
const anyMatch = await apiService.searchAgentsByCapabilities([1, 2], false);

// Find agents that can do email processing AND data processing
const allMatch = await apiService.searchAgentsByCapabilities([1, 2], true);
```

### Getting Agent Capabilities

```javascript
// Get agent with capabilities included
const agent = await apiService.getAgent('123', { include_capabilities: true });

// Get just the capabilities for an agent
const capabilities = await apiService.getAgentCapabilities('123');
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Discovery** - Users can find agents based on specific capabilities they need
2. **Better Organization** - Agents are categorized not just by industry but by what they do
3. **Flexible Search** - Support for both "any" and "all" capability matching
4. **User Experience** - Intuitive capability selection interface
5. **API Extensibility** - Comprehensive API for capability management
6. **Data Integrity** - Proper database constraints and relationships

## Future Enhancements

1. **Capability Ratings** - Allow users to rate how well agents perform specific capabilities
2. **Custom Capabilities** - Allow users to suggest new capability categories
3. **Capability Verification** - System to verify that agents actually provide claimed capabilities
4. **Advanced Filtering** - Combine capabilities with other filters (category, rating, etc.)
5. **Capability Analytics** - Track which capabilities are most sought after

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Database table creation and seeding ✅
- API endpoints responding correctly ✅
- Frontend components loading capabilities ✅
- Form integration working ✅

All 15 predefined capability categories have been successfully seeded in the database and are available via the API endpoints.
